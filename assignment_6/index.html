                        <h1>All About Node.js</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>Node.js is a server side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript engine.
                           Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009.  Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.  Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.  There is a long and exhaustive list of projects, applications, and companies using Node.js including eBay, General Electric, GoDaddy, PayPal, Microsoft and Yahoo!.</p>
                           <br>
                        <p>There are three important things that make Node.js different than existing server-side languages.  These include speed, easability, and reusability.  It is a server-side JavaScript framework which means its code is the same as that that powers Ajax applications like Gmail will not power its servers too.  It is driven by asynchronous design.  That means it doesn't have to wait for slow file I/O or database operations to contine processing, which makes it extremely fast.  This also means it can handle millions of current connections at once.  It also allows easy creation of real-time applications, such as a chat application.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>An interesting example I found to help better understand the concept of nonblocking I/O, is comparing this process to ordering food at a restaurant counter.  The server at the counter is only able to serve one customer at a time, while the customer's behind the first customer are "blocked" from ordering until the first customer can give its order to the server.  The customers who are "blocked" must sit and wait to complete their order.  Non-blocking I/O is similar to adding more cashier lines in order to serve more customers simultaneously. Node.js loops through the customers and polls each customer to determine who is ready to order.  During a function's queue, Node can listen to another event.  When the customer is finally ready to order, he'll issue a "callback".  This is the feature provide by Node.js asynchronous callback, or functions that are called at the completion of a given task.  </p>
